Hello & welcome to Scanly, a university project for module 206CDE. The project is an open-source chatbot, licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public Licence](/licence). For the task, we have to use [botkit.ai](https://botkit.ai/) & as BSc Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking students, we have decided to make a chatbox frontend for security tools. The main aims that we have for this project is to make security tools more easier to use for beginers, & hope that this chatbox can be utilised by SMB IT Departments, in order to improve their network security.

We only started the project W/c Monday 2nd October 2020 - so our in the 'live' development phase, and we hope to share more details with you in the near future, so watch this space!
