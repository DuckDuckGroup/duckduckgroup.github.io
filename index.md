Hello and welcome to Scanly, a university project for module 206CDE. The project is an open-source chatbot, licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public Licence](/licence). For the task, we have to use [botkit.ai](https://botkit.ai/) and as  Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking students, we have decided to make a chatbox frontend for security tools. The main aim that we have for this project is to make security tools easier to use for beginners, and we hope that this chatbox can be utilised by SMB IT Departments, in order to improve their network security.

We only started the project W/c Monday 2nd October 2020 - so are in the 'live' development phase and hope to share more details with you in the near future. Watch this space!
