Welcome to Scanly. A university project for 206CDE, which is an [open-source](/licence/) chatbot, using [botkit.ai](https://botkit.ai/){:target="_blank"} and acts as a frontend for security tools. As Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Students, we aimed to make security tools easier to use for beginners, and we hope that this chatbox can be utilised by SMB IT Departments, in order to improve their network security.
